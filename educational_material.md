# Introduction
The Sandia Interactive Wave Energy Education Display (SIWEED) gives users a unique hands-on experience with wave energy.
This interactive display comprises a small wave tank (about the size of fish tank), a wave maker, a small wave energy converter, and a small model town.

As students change the waves amplitude and frequency operating a graphic user interface, they observe how the energy generated by the wave energy converter (WEC) changes.
The level of power generated is illustrated by the miniature town, which lights up as the generated power changes.
This experience gives users a rare, up close opportunity to interact with marine hydro kinetic energy, and its possible applications to the blue economy.

There are a variety of science topics that relate to the SIWEED display.
Regardless the grade level students can learn about wave energy in conjunction with grade appropriate science standards.
The SIWEED display offers students a unique opportunity to see the practical applications of the sciences, learn about renewable energy, and engage hands on.
The SIWEED display can be used to show basic science topics, like energy and waves, as well as introduce and start a discussion around climate change, renewable energy, and human impact.

Below is a list of teaching resources, relevant topics, and science standards.
There are also premade slides giving an overview of wave energy and the wave tank, tailored to Elementary School, Middle School, and High School Students.

## Damping
Wave Energy Converters harvest the energy of waves.
The amount of energy generated by a wave energy converter is not just dependent on the size of the waves, it also depends on how the wave energy converter responds to the waves.
To increase the amount of power generated we use something called dampening.

**Before we get going on the WEC we are going to run a small experiment with just our hands.**

 - For this experiment you are going to press and rub your hands together and record your observations below. 
 - You will run this experiment three times: 
	 1. Once with your hands pressed together as lightly as possible
	 1. Once with medium pressure
	 1. Once while pressing your hands together as hard as you can
 - Take a break between each trial to ensure your hands can cool down. 


| |How much heat did your hands produce| How fast could you rub your hands together|
|-|-|-|
|Pressing hands together lightly| | |
|Pressing hands together moderately| | |
|Pressing hands together hard| | |

**Which trial created the most heat?**

**Complete the sentence:**
As we press our hands together harder, we create ___________ (**more / less**) heat but the speed at which we can rub our hands together __________(**increases / decreases**). 

The heat from our hands is like the power produced by the WEC.
The pressure we apply is equivalent to the damping we apply to the WEC. 

**Based on your observations above fill out your predictions for the WECs behavior.**

| |How much power will the WEC produce?|How fast will the WEC move up and down?|
|-|-|-|
|Low damping| | |
|Moderate damping| | |
|High damping| | |

**Now run an experiment! While keeping the waves consistent change the damping of the WEC and see how the speed and power of the WEC change.**

| |How much power did the WEC produce?|How fast did the WEC move up and down?|
|-|-|-|
|Low damping| | |
|Moderate damping| | |
|High damping| | |

**What was the ideal damping to create the most power?**

**Do these results surprise you? Explain your answer**

## How does the power in ocean waves compare to what we use in our homes

The power in 1 meter of wavefront from an ocean wave can be computed by the following formula:

$$J = \frac{1}{64 \pi}$$ \rho g^2 H_{m0}^2 T_e$$

Here, $\rho$ is the [density of the water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seawater#Density) (about 1025 kg/m$^3$ for seawater), $g$ is the [acceleration due to gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_acceleration) (9.81 m/s$^2$), $H_{m0}$ is the [significant wave height](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Significant_wave_height) and $T_e$ is the energy period.

A handy trick to find the power in units of kW/m is to use the following equation with $H_{m0}$ in meters and $T_e$ in seconds:

$$J \approx \frac{1}{2} H_{m0}^2 T_e$$

This means that a 1 m wave with an 8 second period would have approximately 4 kW in every meter along its crest.

**Let's compare this with some of the power loads SIWEED's the seaside town display**

|Structure | Daily Energy Use (kWh/day) | Average Power (kW)|
|-- | -- | --|
|Lighthouse lightbulb | 24 | 1.0|
|Lighthouse cottage | 20 | 0.833|
|House | 30 | 1.25|
|General Store | 14.3 | 0.5958|
|Fishing store (beach) | 14.3 | 0.5958|
|Storage building | 3.84 (10 16-watt tube   bulbs) | 0.16|
|Shed | 0.96 (4 100-watt bulbs) | 0.04|
|Lamp Posts (6) | 8.64 | 0.36|
|**Total** | **116.04** | **4.835**|
