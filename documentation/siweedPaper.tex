\textbf{Abstract:} Wave energy converters are a nascent energy generation technology that harness the power in ocean waves.
To assist in communicating both fundamental and complex concepts of wave energy, a small scale portable wave tank and wave energy converter have been developed.
The system has been designed using commercial off-the-shelf components and the all design hardware and software are openly available for replication.

\section{Hardware in context} % Include a short description of the hardware, putting into context of similar open hardware and proprietary equipment in the field.
The SIWEED is a small scale wave tank that is designed to be portable and serve in outreach and dissemination of wave energy research.
The development of this system was inspired by previous research at Sandia National Labs in the areas of wave energy converter (WEC) device and control design and testing.
Specifically, the SIWEED demonstrates the causal feedback control and device design principles described in \citet{Bacelli2020} and \citet{Coe2020a}.


A wide variety of similar educational wave tanks and tow tanks have been built, but few have been documented.
\citet{unger2006creating} reworked the a tow tank at MIT to enable remote operation via the internet.

This is a novel expansion on similar small-scale educational wave tanks, as the user is able to control both the waves and the WEC device.


\section{Hardware description} % Describe the hardware, highlighting the customization rather than the steps of the procedure. Highlight how it differs/which advantage it offers over pre-existing methods. For example, how could this hardware: be compared to other hardware in terms of cost or ease of use, be used in the development of further designs in a particular area, and so on. Add 3-5 bulleted points to broadly explain to other researchers how the hardware could be potentially useful to them, for either standard or novel laboratory tasks, inside or outside of the original user community.
The SIWEED is composed of a 1.5\,m $\times{}$ 0.3\,m $\times{}$ 0.5\,m (filled to roughly 0.3\,m deep) acrylic tank, housing a vertical plunger style wave maker (see, e.g., \cite{hyun1976simplified}), and a single body WEC modeled on the WaveBot~\cite{Coe2016a}.
A system diagram is shown in \figurename~XX.

The system is controlled by a Windows PC running a graphical user interface (GUI) developed using Processing\footnote{\url{https://processing.org}} and the controlP5 library\footnote{\url{http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/}}.
A screen shot of the GUI is shown in \figurename~\ref{fig:siweed_guiScreenShot}.
The upper left hand part of the GUI pertains to control of the wave maker, which allows the user to switch between operational modes (``jog,'' ``function,'' ``sea state,'' and ``off'') and set the relevant parameters.
If, for example, the system is in ``sea state'' mode, the user can set the significant wave height ($H_s$), peak frequency ($f_p$), and peakedness factor ($\gamma$) for a JONSWAP wave spectrum.

\begin{figure}[tb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{diagrams/siweed_guiScreenShot.png}
  \caption{Graphical user interface (GUI) screenshot.}
  \label{fig:siweed_guiScreenShot}
\end{figure}

The lower left hand quadrant of the GUI contains controls for the WEC, which can be set into ``torque'' mode; in which the user directly sets a commanded torque, ``feedback'' mode; where proportional and integral feedback factors can be set by the user; ``multi-sine'' mode, which allows for open-loop multi-sine signals to be set by the user; and ``off.''

The right hand portion of the GUI shows plots and indicators of the system status.
XX\dots{}

Two Arduino microcontrollers, one Due and one Mega, are used to control and acquire signals from the WEC and wave maker.

A number of key factors of SIWEED are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Open-source and documented design:} To our knowledge, the SIWEED is the first educational wave tank and WEC system to be fully documented with an open-source design and software package.
  This will enabled interested researchers and students to efficiently develop replicates and variations of the SIWEED design for their own purposes.
  \item \textbf{Portability:} To allow for transport to conferences and outreach events, the SIWEED has been specifically designed to allow for easy transportation.
  \item \textbf{WEC control:} In addition to demonstrating the physics of ocean waves, the SIWEED allows users to interact with a WEC control system to better understand the principles of reactive feedback control to maximize power absorption for the waves.
  \item \textbf{Student-led design:} The SIWEED project has been a student-led design project involving XX undergraduate engineering students.
\end{itemize}
